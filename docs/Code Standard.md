# OSGeo Nepal Standard to follow 

Projects applying to the *OSGeo Nepal Community* program are asked to:

1. Be geospatial
    * Confirm by checking README or project description
    * project page on the OSGeo Nepal website
    * We ask projects have some user documentation, for example an [GeoTile Getting Started](https://geotile.readthedocs.io/)

2. Have a free license or an open source license.
    * The license must be OSI approved
    * We ask that the project team check the file headers and double check the license has been appropriately applied
3. Welcome participation and new contributors.
    * We look for a clear contribution policy
    * We ask that the project demonstrate collaboration, perhaps with a history of bug report or pull requests
    * Projects are required to have a code of conduct


OSGeo Community Projects can take part in the incubation committee for guidance on open source use, setting up project governance, promoting the project, and building the project community. We look forward to working with you.

# Code Standard to follow (For Developers)

## Python

* Formatting & syntax: [Pylint](https://www.pylint.org/), [Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/user/index.html); Auto-formatter in vs-code ([Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)).

* Follow docstring conventions as outlined by [PEP 257](https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/).

* Include code test functions in repo. Some popular choice maybe [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.4.x/), [Unitest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html).

* Must include `README.md` file in a project directory.


## Python documentation

* The documentation can be generated via [read the docs](https://about.readthedocs.com/) library.

* Must include `installation guide`, `getting_started` & `API auto documentation`.


## Javascript 

* Code formatter to use in visual code: [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode).

* Must include `README.md` file in the project directory.
